To better understand the writing experience and challenges facing university students in China, we conducted a questionnaire and 50 Chinese students (n=50; female=32; male=18) from three second-tier universities answered the questionnaire (tertiary educational institutions can be classified by university rankings into top-tier, first-tier, second-tier, third-tier and those under third-tiers are called colleges). The questions focused on their writing experience, teacher feedback and attitude towards game-based writing. The respondents were asked to first report their most recent nationally or internationally recognized exam scores as indicators of their English levels. 25 respondents reported their College English Test (CET) Level 4 scores (7 fails and 18 passes, full score=710, min=325, max=580); 1 respondent passed CET Level 6 (higher than Level 4, score=453); 20 respondents reported their English test scores in the College Entrance Exam (full score=150, min=38; max=121). The remaining 4 respondents refused to disclose their scores. As the CET is a norm-referenced test, which means the final score shows how well test takers have done relative to the whole group, the actual scores cannot be summed or averaged for students not taking the same exam. Different areas in China also use different sets of exams in the College Entrance Exam, and therefore the scores cannot be summed or averaged, either. By carefully calibrating the scores to the CEFR standards, the English levels of respondents ranged from A1 (n=8), A2 (n=25), B1(n=7) to B2(n=6).

# Student Interests

In the questionnaire, the researcher asked whether students would be interested if their teachers integrate a computer game into the English writing classroom, offer instructions on game language, allow them to play the game in the class and assign them relevant writing tasks. A comment box was added after the questions for students to express the reasons why they thought so. The students&#39; responses are shown in Table 1 below:

_Table 1. Students&#39; interest towards GBW_

| **Answer choices** | **No. of respondents** | **percentage** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Very interested** | 13 | 26.00% |
| **Interested** | 30 | 60.00% |
| **I don&#39;t know** | 7 | 14.00% |
| **Not interested** | 0 | 0.00% |
| **Not at all interested** | 0 | 0.00% |
| **Total** | 50 | 100.00% |

It can be seen that the majority of students (86%) are interested in the game-based writing class, while 7 students said they did not know if they would be interested. No students reported not interested in such a class. On the basis of this feedback, it may be concluded that game-based writing class at university level is worth investigation in the Chinese context.

# Genre of writing

Question 2 in the questionnaire elicited feedback regarding the most common genres the students had been practicing up to the survey. The choices were offered by the researcher according to genre categories mentioned previously and knowledge of English exams in China. An &#39;others&#39; option was available for students to write answers not included in pre-determined choices. Table 2 in the following shows the result.

_Table 2. Most common writing genres for the students_

| **Answer choices** | **No. of respondents** | **percentage** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Narrative, recounting past events** | 11 | 22.00% |
| **Argumentative, expressing your own opinions and arguments** | 16 | 32.00% |
| **Expositions, explaining how something works or procedures** | 6 | 12.00% |
| **Correspondence, writing letters** | 13 | 26.00% |
| **Description, describing current events or pictures** | 4 | 8.00% |
| **Others** | 0 | 0.00% |
| **Total** | 50 | 100.00% |

The result shows argumentative essays and letters were the primary genres the students wrote in, which are actually the two most dominant genres tested in China&#39;s University Entrance Exam and College English Tests (CET). Narrative ranked third at 22%, while description ranked last at 8%. In a further question regarding whether students searched for background information for writing tasks, their answers were as follows (Table 3):

_Table 3. Use of background information in writing_

| **Answer choices** | **No. of respondents** | **percentage** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **No, I write with only prompts that come with writing tasks** | 24 | 48.00% |
| **Yes, I search for relevant information in Chinese as supplement** | 20 | 40.00% |
| **Yes, I search for relevant information in English as supplement** | 5 | 10.00% |
| **Others** | 1 | 2.00% |
| **Total** | 50 | 100.00% |

Table 3shows that almost half (48%) of the students said they did not use any background information at all and that they completed writing assignments based solely on given writing prompts. Another 40% of the students said they searched for relevant information in Chinese while only 10% utilized English sources. One student commented in &quot;others&quot; that he/she only cross-checked information online after the completion of writing.

Question 6 inquired into students&#39; preferred areas in enhancing their writing skills, in an effort to understand what is considered most practical and urgent by them. Table 4 shows the result.

_Table 4. Most practical areas of writing where students wanted to improve their skills_

| **Answer choices** | **No. of respondents** | **percentage** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Daily topics/communication** | 28 | _56.00%_ |
| **Business writing** | 5 | _10.00%_ |
| **Academic writing** | 8 | _16.00%_ |
| **Exam-oriented writing** | 9 | _18.00%_ |
| **Others** | 0 | _0.00%_ |
| **Total** | 50 | _100.00%_ |

The majority of students (28) said they wanted to improve their writing in daily topics or for daily communication purposes. Nine students preferred more exam-oriented practices. Only 8 students expressed preference for academic writing, and even fewer students thought business writing was practical for them.

# Teacher feedback

In determining modes of teacher feedback, the researcher first asked what kinds of feedback the students were receiving from English teachers at their university. Table 5 in the following shows the result.

_Table 5. Types of feedback the students received_

| **Answer choices** | **No. of respondents** | **percentage** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **No, I receive no feedback from the teacher** | 7 | 14.00% |
| **No, but he/she hands out exemplary samples to us for reference** | 11 | 22.00% |
| **Yes, he/she chooses writing assignments from several students for review in class** | 28 | 56.00% |
| **Yes, he/she gives individual feedback on each student&#39;s writing assignment** | 4 | 8.00% |
| **Others** | 0 | 0.00% |
| **Total** | 50 | 100.00% |

It is clear from the table that the majority of students had teachers who would review some writing assignments in class as group feedback to students. Another 22% received reference samples for them to learn from, and 14% said they received no feedback from the teacher after handing in assignments. Only 4 students received individual feedback from their teachers. Comments given under lack of feedback indicated inadequate class time as the primary reason.

The takeaways from the survey are summarized below:

First, familiarity with argumentative essays is higher than with narrative writing.

Second, topic familiarity in English is a serious issue in writing.

Third, detailed individual feedback to writing was very rare.
